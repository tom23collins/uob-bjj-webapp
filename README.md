# uob-bjj-webapp

## Overview
uob-bjj-webapp is a flask webapp to replace the old sign-up system for the University of Birmingham Brazilian Jiu Jitsu taster sessions during the start of the 2024 academic year.

The current system works by collecting interest/signups via social media which is then recorded manually in a spreadsheet. 
This year there are more taster sessions running so there will be a greater number of students coming to the sessions furthermore the number of committee members managing the sessions has increased which is why I decided to improve the sign-up system.

## My approach
My approach to this project was to create a webapp in which anyone can access key information on the taster session then if they are interested, register an account and sign onto the sessions. 
I discussed with the club president, and we decided that the following key features were needed for the webapp to be useful: 
- A way to create accounts and login to the webapp.
- Committee members can create new events and add information about them.
- Users can sign up to the taster sessions.
- Committee members can then view who has signed up to the session.
  
We also discussed some additional features: 
- Users can register their interest in the session without an account.
- Being able to book a Gi for the session if the user does not have one. 
- reCAPTCHA when creating accounts to prevent automated spam sign ups. 
- Progress tracker/dashboard to see how many sessions you have signed up to.

- 88% of the total 300 available spaces were filled.
- 100% of the availiable spaces for the Nogi sessions were filled. 
- 76% of the availiable spaces for the Gi sessions were filled.
